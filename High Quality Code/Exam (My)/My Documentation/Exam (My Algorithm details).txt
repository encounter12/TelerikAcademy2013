Methods:

PlayVideoGame()

The computer generates random number between 1 and 10, inclusive. The user enters a number between 1 and 10 and if the numbers are the same as the random number generated, the video card should print “You win!” Otherwise, it should print “You didn’t guess the number {0}.” (where “{0}” is the random number generated).
