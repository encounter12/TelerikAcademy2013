Clean up ASP.NET MVC 5 Solution before submitting: 

01. Modify the connection string in Web.config: 

Make sure Data Source is "(LocalDb)\v11.0;
Remove AttachDbFileName section
Change Initial Catalog value to: SampleApp;

For me the connection string looks like: 
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\v11.0;Initial Catalog=SampleApp;Integrated Security=True" 
        providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>

02. Delete all folders with the names below from the Solution: 

\bin
\obj

and delete all files and folders inside folder "packages" EXCLUDING repositories.config file.


03. Empty the content of "SampleApp.Web\App_Data"

*You can first drop the database from Visual Studio (not required)
