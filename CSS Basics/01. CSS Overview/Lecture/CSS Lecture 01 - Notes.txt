<a> elements do not inherit color and decoration of parent elements.

we can have two elements with the same classes, but cannot have two elements with the same id.

<div id="mainContent" class="button menu gogo"> 
</div>

classes: button, menu, gogo

#header + a {color:black;} - takes all the elements #header and "a" that are at the same level and assigns them the color property black

p.post-text.special {font-weight: bold} - selects all the paragraphs that have class post-text and class special 

Ex:
<p class="post-text special">
</p>


reset margins and paddings 

body, h1, p, ul, li {margin: 0; padding: 0; }
