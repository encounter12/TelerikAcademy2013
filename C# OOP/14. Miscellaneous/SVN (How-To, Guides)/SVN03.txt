if you plan to make changes, use this command to check out the code as yourself using HTTPS:
# Project members authenticate over HTTPS to allow committing changes.
svn checkout https://team-kyanite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ team-kyanite --username encounter12@gmail.com

When prompted, enter your generated googlecode.com password: tN8VP5wN2xb4 



Where do I get a password for committing to Subversion?

If you're a project owner or committer, just look at your "Settings" tab of your profile page. It will display your googlecode.com password. This password is used for access to your project's Subversion repository and for command-line file uploads to your project's Downloads area. This password is not the same as the password that you use to access your project on the web.
