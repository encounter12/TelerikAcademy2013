        <h2>Web Storages - Number guessing game (Rams and Sheep)</h2>
        <p>
            Description: Create a simple number guessing gam. The computer generates a random number with four different digits. The leftmost digit must not be 0 (zero). For simplicity called abcd. At each turn the player enters a four-digit number. For simplicity called xyzw. When the game ends: Ask the player for a nickname. Save the nickname inside the localStorage. Implement a high-score list. Sheep means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd, but not on the same position. If two such digits exists, the sheep are 2. Ram means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd and it is on the same position. If two such digits exists, the rams are 2. The game continues until the player guesses the number abcd i.e. has 4 rams.
