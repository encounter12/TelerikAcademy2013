Your First Automatic Migration

Code First Migrations has two commands that you are going to become familiar with.

    Add-Migration will scaffold the next migration based on changes you have made to your model.
    Update-Database will apply any pending changes to the database.

We are going to avoid using Add-Migration (unless we really need to) and focus on letting Code First Migrations automatically calculate and apply the changes. Letâ€™s use Update-Database to get Code First Migrations to push the changes to our model (the new Blog.Url property) to the database.

    Run the Update-Database command in Package Manager Console.

Code First Migrations has now updated the MigrationsAutomaticDemo.BlogContext database to include the Url column in the Blogs table.
