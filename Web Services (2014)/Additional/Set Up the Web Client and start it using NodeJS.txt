1. Start your Visual Studio Web API Project (Ctrl + F5) and copy the Url (for me it is: http://localhost:51860/) in a text document

2. Configure the Web Client app.js baseUrl

2.1. Open the Web Client app.js file located in the Web Client 'js' folder

2.2. Change the baseUrl in app.js

Replace the Url string in the line looking like: .constant('baseUrl', 'http://localhost:51860')

with the one you have copied in step 1 (the Url address of your Web API Project)

2.3. Save the changes made in app.js and close the file


3. Start the NodeJS Web Server (located in the Web Client folder) 

3.1. Open cmd in the Web Client folder

Open the Web Client folder, Shift + Right-click - Open Command Window Here

3.2. Copy and Paste the name of the .bat file (including the extension) in cmd, for me it is: 'start-server.bat'
Press Enter.

In the cmd window a message will appear, look at the bottom, you will see something like: 

Http Server running at http://localhost:5000/

3.3. Copy the web address in a text document (we will need it in step 4).

4. Open the Web client (through the running NodeJS Server) in the browser

Copy the web address from the CMD Window bottom (see step 3.3, for me it is: http://localhost:5000/) and paste it in the web browser. Press Enter.

The Web Client will open in the browser - in the browser web address field it will be written something like: http://localhost:5000/#/home.
